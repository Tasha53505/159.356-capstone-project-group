<h4>Squeezebox Radio/Touch/Controller and Logitech Media Server 8+</h4>

<p>Unfortunately some firmwares for Squeezebox Radio, Touch, and Controller come with a bug which prevents them from connecting correctly
to Logitech Media Server 8+. The version string comparison function fails to recognize 8.0.0 as more recent than 7.7.3.
While the bug has been fixed years ago in version 7.8, the fixed firmware never got released to all devices. Unfortunately we're at this point not
able to build a fixed firmware for distribution.</p>

<p>But there's a patch available, which you can easily install on an existing Squeezebox Radio/Touch/Controller:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On the Squeezebox go to Settings/Advanced/Applet Installer, install the Patch Installer. The device will re-boot.</li>
	<li>Once it's back, go to Settings/Advanced/Patch Installer and install the "Version Comparison Fix".</li>
	<li>When done patching all your devices you might need to restart Logitech Media Server to make the warning go away.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy the music on your Squeezebox Radio/Touch/Controller!</p>
